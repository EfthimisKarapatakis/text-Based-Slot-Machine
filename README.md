# The game includes:

 Multiple paylines: You can bet on up to 3 lines.
 Customizable bet amount: Set your bet per line between $1 and $100.
 Random slot outcomes: Each spin generates a random slot configuration using different symbols (A, B, C, D) with varying probabilities and payouts.
 Winning calculations: Based on the symbols lined up across the paylines, winnings are calculated and added to the player's balance.

# How it Works:
 Deposit money to start.
 Choose how many lines you want to bet on (up to 3).
 Place your bet per line.
 Spin the slot machine and check if you've won based on the symbols.
 Continue playing until you choose to quit or run out of money.

The code demonstrates the use of Python functions for input validation, randomization, and logic for determining wins in a slot machine game.
